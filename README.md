Mechanical Engineering Design Handbook Locator

Project Description:
An interactive web tool developed solely for educational purposes to quickly locate specific concepts, formulas, and tables within the "Design Data Handbook for Mechanical Engineers in SI and Metric Units" by K. Mahadevan and K. Balaveera Reddy. This project is for only educational purpose.

Features
Comprehensive Indexing: Provides direct references to chapters, equations, tables, and figures for a wide range of mechanical engineering design topics.

Intuitive Interface: A simple dropdown menu allows users to easily select a concept and retrieve relevant handbook pages.

Detailed Information: Each lookup provides a brief description of the concept along with specific page numbers and types of references (e.g., Equation, Table, Figure).

Responsive Design: Built with Tailwind CSS for a clean, modern, and adaptive layout across various devices.

How to Use:
Open the Datahand book locator.html file in your web browser.

Select a concept, component, or term from the dropdown menu.

Click the "Locate Information in Handbook" button.

The relevant handbook references, including chapter names, page numbers, and descriptions, will be displayed below.

Important Disclaimer:
This tool is intended for educational and quick reference purposes only. Due to potential variations across different editions of the handbook, there may be discrepancies in the exact page numbers or content. Always verify the information with your physical copy of the original "Design Data Handbook" before making any critical engineering decisions or calculations. The creators of this web tool are not responsible for any inaccuracies or consequences arising from the use of this information.

Technologies Used
HTML5: For the basic structure of the webpage.

CSS3 (Tailwind CSS): For modern, responsive, and utility-first styling.

JavaScript: For handling user interaction and data lookup.

Future Enhancements (Ideas)
Add a search bar for direct keyword searching instead of just dropdown selection.

Implement filtering for different types of references (equations only, tables only).

Allow users to contribute or correct page number discrepancies for different editions.
